 Brian Ali's Hackathon Portfolio made with pain and suffering due to lack of framework usage.

 

"Committing once a day, makes your career as a programmer 1 step away" — Brian Ali

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This is where chaos meets code, and coffee meets commits. Built with pure HTML and CSS 

I Used github pages and netlify for its deployment

## 🚀 Portfolio Features.


- 🎪 Interactive Elements

    Role Rotator: Watch "Frontend" → "Backend" → "Fullstack" dance across the screen / purely html and css.
    Floating Dot Animation: Those achievement cards have dots that move around the border (yes, I spent way too much time on this)
    Spinning Tech Icons: 60-second rotation cycle because why not?
    Terminal Simulation: Complete with realistic command prompts and witty responses

- 🎨 Design Philosophy

    ```css
    /* My design mantra */
    .aesthetic-over-everything {
        rule: "Once added a 20MB library to move an icon 2px. No regrets.";
        priority: "Make the web less ugly, one div at a time";
    }

## 📱 Sections Breakdown

- 🏠 Hero Section

    Animated role rotation (took me 3 hours to get right)

    Social links that invert colors on hover (the little things matter!)

- 👨‍💻 About Section

    GitHub stats integration (because numbers don't lie)
    Tech stack grid with spinning icons

## Optimizations

- 🌙 Smooth scrolling navigation 🔝 Back-to-top button that scales on hover 💫 Micro-interactions throughout
